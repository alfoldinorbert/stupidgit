Installation
============

The easiest way to install StupidGit is to download one of its binary releases:
  http://github.com/gyim/stupidgit/downloads

If you want to run the latest, unreleased version of StupidGit, simply clone
the StupidGit repository to any place you want. You can either run StupidGit
from this directory or create a binary release with one of the following
commands:

  - Windows:
    - setup.py py2exe
    - setup.iss (press F9 and then Ctrl-F9 to create a setup package)
  - Ubuntu Linux: make builddeb
  - Mac OS X: make buildapp
  - Other systems: python setup.py install

For creating binary releases you will need to install Python >=2.5, wxPython,
setuptools and py2exe+InnoSetup/debhelper scripts/py2app, respectively.

Running StupidGit
=================

To run StupidGit, you will need the following packages:
- Python >= 2.5
  - Windows: http://www.python.org/download/
  - Ubuntu Linux: installed by default
  - OS X: installed by default
- wxPython >= 2.8
  - Windows: http://www.wxpython.org/download.php
  - Ubuntu Linux: apt-get install python-wxgtk2.8
  - OS X Leopard: installed by default.
  - OS X Snow Leopard: installed by default, but you should make sure
    that Python is running in 32 bit mode.
- Git >= 1.6
  ... if this is not installed yet, you probably don't need this program ;)
  StupidGit is tested with the standard git-core package on Ubuntu,
  the MacPorts git-core package on OS X and msysgit on Windows.

StupidGit will search git binary on the following locations:
- PATH
- on Unix platforms: /opt/local/bin (for MacPorts), /usr/local/git/bin (OSX build)
- on Windows: C:\Program Files\Git\bin (default path for msysgit)

On unix systems it is useful to create a symlink to
<StupidGit_dir>/bin/stupidgit from a directory which is in the PATH. If you
invoke stupidgit from a directory which is inside a git repository, it will
open that repo by default (just as gitk does).

External merge tools:
=====================

It is advised to install an external merge tool for StupidGit. Currently the
following tools are supported:

  - Windows: WinMerge
  - OS X: DiffMerge
  - Unix (including OS X): meld

Merge tools are searched in PATH and in their default installation
directories.
